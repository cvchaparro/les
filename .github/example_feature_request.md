# I want to be able to be able to randomly assign question recordings to my students

As an ESL teacher, I want to be able to randomly assign different question recordings to all of my students so that I can ensure they are being tested accurately instead of just hearing what other students say and repeating that.

AC:
- [ ] When I create a new test, I should have the option of randomly assigning question recordings to every student.
- [ ] When I create a new test, I should also have the option of assigning the same question recordings to every student.
